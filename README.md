# Nvidia Stock Price Analysis (1999–Present) 📈

**A quantitative analysis of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) historical market performance using Python.**

---

## 📂 Project Overview
This project explores the historical trajectory of NVIDIA stock to identify key market trends and technological shifts over the past two decades. By leveraging the **Yahoo Finance API**, the analysis captures the company's evolution from a niche graphics hardware manufacturer to a dominant force in the AI revolution.

The core workflow is documented in **`main.ipynb`**, covering data extraction, cleaning, and visualization.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
1.  **Automated Extraction:** Programmatically retrieving the maximum available historical data (1999–Present) using `yfinance`.
2.  **Data Engineering:** Processing raw financial data with `pandas` to ensure correct datetime formatting and index management.
3.  **Visual Analytics:** Generating long-term trend visualizations with `matplotlib` to map price evolution against market events.
4.  **Trend Interpretation:** Breaking down the stock's history into distinct growth phases, from early stability to the recent exponential surge.

## 📊 Analysis Highlights
The notebook identifies four distinct phases in NVIDIA's market behavior:

| Period | Phase | Key Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1999–2015** | **Latency Period** | Prolonged stability with minimal volatility compared to modern trading volumes. |
| **2016–2020** | **The Breakout** | Consistent growth driven by gaming and early data center adoption. |
| **2020–2022** | **Volatility** | A significant rally followed by corrections due to post-pandemic supply chain dynamics. |
| **2023–Present** | **Exponential Surge** | A "hockey stick" growth curve correlated with the Generative AI boom. |
